        <p><strong>2.2</strong>&emsp;No contract exists in respect to any request for translation services, or in respect to any Source Materials that may be submitted to A Word in the Hand, unless and until there is an Accepted Quote.

        <p><strong>2.4</strong>&emsp;A Word in the Hand reserves the right to decline to issue a Quote, or to provide any translation services, if the Source Materials contain anything that A Word in the Hand (at its discretion, and without any obligation on A Word in the Hand to review the Source Materials for appropriateness, legality or otherwise) considers to be offensive, obscene, contrary to any law, or otherwise considered by A Word in the Hand to be inappropriate.</p>


        <br/>
        <h2><strong>3.</strong>&emsp;Provision of Services</h2>

        <p><strong>3.2</strong>&emsp;The Client must provide all information requested by A Word in the Hand (via the Website), in respect of the Services, and ensure that all such information is accurate and complete.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3.3</strong>&emsp;A Word in the Hand provides services at different specified quality levels. It is the Client’s responsibility to select the preferred level of service to suit its requirements. A Word in the Hand will deliver to the selected level of service, as specified in the Accepted Quote, and has no obligation to check whether that quality level is appropriate for the Client’s needs.</p>

        <p><strong>3.4</strong>&emsp;A Word in the Hand has no responsibility to complete the translation for the price quoted, if the word count and or nature of the translation varies from what was able to be gained from the Source Materials when first quoted. A Word in the Hand will provide the Client with a corrected quote, with the difference owing for completion of the job and amended delivery date, if necessary. The Client may opt to instead receive a full refund, if the correct quote is not acceptable.</p>

        <p><strong>3.5</strong>&emsp;Should a Client purchase the translation services on a Sunday, then it may result in a minor delay in the timeframe to complete.  A Word in the Hand will endeavor to ensure this does not happen but will notify the Client as soon as practicably possible on a Monday, informing them of any delay.</p>

        <p><strong>3.6</strong>&emsp;A Word in the Hand has no responsibility to review the quality of the Source Materials for typographical or any other errors, and has no liability to review the Source Material for or to correct any errors or omissions contained in any Source Materials, regardless of the nature of such errors or omissions, and regardless of the impact that such errors or omissions may have on the quality of the Deliverables.</p>

        <p><strong>3.7</strong>&emsp;On completion of the Services, and subject to receipt by A Word in the Hand of all amounts due from the Client, A Word in the Hand will issue the Deliverables to the Client.</p>

        <p><strong>3.8</strong>&emsp;A Word in the Hand will issue the Deliverables to the Client, in accordance with A Word in the Hand’s standard practices and procedures applicable at the time or as otherwise specified in the Quote or on the website. A Word in the Hand will endeavor to issue the Deliverables on or before the agreed delivery date / time, or where no specific delivery date/ time is agreed within a reasonable time following receipt of the Accepted Quote, but A Word in the Hand accepts no liability for any delay in meeting the applicable timing.</p>

                <li>50% of the total amount payable is due prior to commencement of the Services; and</li>
                <li>the remaining 50% of the total amount payable is due prior to release of the Deliverables to the Client; and</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li>&emsp;if A Word in the Hand expects the duration of the Services to exceed 30 days:
            <ol type="i">
              <li>30% of the total amount payable is due prior to commencement of the Services;</li>
              <li>30% of the total amount payable is due half way through the expected duration of the Services (for example if the Services are expected to take 40 days, the second payment is due on day 20); and</li>
              <li>the final 40% of the total amount payable is due prior to release of the Deliverables to the Client.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>A Word in the Hand may suspend provision of Services or may cease to provide the Services or Deliverables, and may at its discretion terminate the Contract in accordance with clause 10.2.</li>
        </ol>


        <br/>
        <h2><strong>5.</strong>&emsp;Refund policy</h2>

        <p><strong>5.1</strong>&emsp;A Word in the Hand will provide a refund to the Client, in respect of the affected Services, if:</p>
