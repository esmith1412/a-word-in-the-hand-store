00:00:19.226 --> 00:00:21.744
(Anastasia Garcia)
Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:30.947
(Man) Anastasia, it's a pleasure

00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:33.918
to have you here at this first
TEDxBogota event for women.

00:00:33.942 --> 00:00:35.776
We're excited to have you here,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.023
a woman full of courage,
leadership, and desire for change,

00:00:40.047 --> 00:00:45.509
who was able to travel to India
and learn about solar engineering --

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:49.982
something few people in the auditorium
may know or understand --

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:53.675
and you did that in another language,
emerged in another culture,

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.795
entirely different
from your own, the Wayuu.

00:00:56.461 --> 00:01:01.216
It required a lot from you,
in your personal development

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.888
and your community's development.

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:06.804
Why did you accept this challenge,

00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:11.682
this urge to travel so far
to learn something new?

00:01:12.677 --> 00:01:19.275
(AG) I wanted to go
to a country I haven't been to before.

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:26.685
Planning it was a motivation for me,

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.338
envisioning something different
from what I have in my community

00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:36.470
for the well-being of my Wayuu village.

00:01:38.628 --> 00:01:41.370
I wanted to obtain knowledge

00:01:42.495 --> 00:01:49.393
in solar engineering
for mothers and grandmothers

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.605
living in rural areas in the various
regions of this country,

00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:04.041
in order to bring change
to our communities,

00:02:04.065 --> 00:02:06.937
that can lead
to a better life for everyone.

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:12.199
(Man) You traveled 16,000 km
to a completely different culture.

00:02:12.223 --> 00:02:14.263
I understand that you don't speak English.

00:02:14.287 --> 00:02:15.713
(AG) No.

00:02:15.737 --> 00:02:18.104
It was the first time
that I boarded a plane.

00:02:18.128 --> 00:02:19.315
(Laughter)

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:23.716
(Man) How were you able to understand
what they were teaching you?

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.236
And how did others understand
what you were saying?

00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:31.194
(AG) By using signs.

00:02:33.704 --> 00:02:38.870
By listening and repeating many times --

00:02:38.894 --> 00:02:41.957
a hundred times, like children do.

00:02:45.424 --> 00:02:52.275
We would write everything down
into a notebook.

00:02:54.941 --> 00:03:01.917
We would draw the tools they showed us.

00:03:02.585 --> 00:03:04.483
The drawings weren't great --

00:03:04.507 --> 00:03:06.292
I'm not a good artist --

00:03:06.316 --> 00:03:11.014
so I gave them numbers
in order to remember them.

00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:18.271
I couldn't use English,
so I learned numbers and colors.

00:03:20.343 --> 00:03:25.217
I learned colors in order
to associate them with numbers.

00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:27.317
That's how we learned.

00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:32.152
Repeating them a thousand times a day,

00:03:32.176 --> 00:03:35.125
morning til evening,

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:37.820
all day, from Monday to Friday.

00:03:38.362 --> 00:03:43.398
(Man) That method was based
on an Indian education model,

00:03:45.357 --> 00:03:48.264
to include illiterate
and semi-illiterate women,

00:03:48.288 --> 00:03:50.712
mothers and grandmothers.

00:03:50.736 --> 00:03:56.094
And the technique works primarily
with numbers, colors and signs.

00:03:56.118 --> 00:03:58.865
What happened
if someone didn't understand?

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.866
What was the process
to ensure ideas could flow,

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.727
and for you to be able
to learn solar engineering?

00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:11.498
(AG) The same way
they were teaching us using signs,

00:04:12.655 --> 00:04:16.360
we would sign among classmates,

00:04:17.885 --> 00:04:23.369
and be able to understand
each other that way.

00:04:23.393 --> 00:04:25.412
That's how it flowed.

00:04:25.436 --> 00:04:29.457
(Man) It's a little like returning
to infancy: signs, colors, gestures.

00:04:29.481 --> 00:04:32.487
(AG) Yes, gestures and movements.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.559
(Man) This is clearly
a transforming experience --

00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:42.533
an opportunity for many women worldwide

00:04:42.557 --> 00:04:47.040
who are discriminated against
or undervalued by their communities.

00:04:47.064 --> 00:04:51.731
It's a program offered
by the Barefoot College

00:04:51.755 --> 00:04:57.137
to provide education, which can then
be shared among the communities.

00:04:57.161 --> 00:04:59.849
This program is solely for women
from around the world.

00:04:59.873 --> 00:05:02.396
Who were your friends?
Who did you meet there?

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.942
Who did you get along with
so far from home?

00:05:05.966 --> 00:05:11.053
We were 40 women from
different countries around the world.

00:05:13.103 --> 00:05:17.582
From here, Panamanians and Nicaraguans.

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:24.546
There were Africans,
and women from Myanmar.

00:05:25.252 --> 00:05:30.244
I made friends with women from Zanzibar,

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.435
the coastal area of Africa.

00:05:37.012 --> 00:05:41.314
We got along well, they were very funny;

00:05:41.338 --> 00:05:43.421
they soon made me forget

00:05:43.445 --> 00:05:48.890
that I was far from my family, my country.

00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:51.570
They made me feel at home.

00:05:53.943 --> 00:05:58.428
(Man) Surely, there were
some sad or lonely moments.

00:05:58.452 --> 00:06:00.650
How did you cope with that?

00:06:00.674 --> 00:06:02.373
How did you overcome depression?

00:06:02.397 --> 00:06:06.684
(AG) After four or five months --

00:06:06.708 --> 00:06:09.055
it was six in total --

00:06:11.193 --> 00:06:18.170
I felt far away from my people,
my family, children, and grandchildren.

00:06:18.194 --> 00:06:20.401
I wanted to be by their side.

00:06:20.425 --> 00:06:23.642
So I got closer to the Hindu people,

00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:27.419
who were very kind to us,

00:06:29.237 --> 00:06:33.205
who accepted us,
and gave us that education.

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:37.119
They were very kind,

00:06:37.143 --> 00:06:41.506
and very nice during the classes.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.157
We learned from them how to be humble,

00:06:46.992 --> 00:06:49.295
and organized.

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:51.319
They are organized.

00:06:52.921 --> 00:06:56.493
In spite of the difficulties,
they are organized.

00:06:57.329 --> 00:07:00.445
(Man) You traveled
to learn solar engineering.

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:02.095
What did you learn specifically?

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:05.518
What are the learnings you're going
to share with your community?

00:07:05.542 --> 00:07:10.930
(AG) I now have knowledge
that I can spread in Columbia --

00:07:10.954 --> 00:07:13.086
knowledge that can affect me personally.

00:07:13.859 --> 00:07:19.556
If I'm needed somewhere
where there are other women,

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.548
who have been to some faraway continent,

00:07:25.514 --> 00:07:27.693
I can collaborate with them

00:07:29.313 --> 00:07:32.805
on the installation, repair

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:35.804
and construction of the equipment

00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:43.762
where solar energy will be captured,

00:07:43.786 --> 00:07:46.940
because they taught us how to do it,

00:07:49.865 --> 00:07:52.218
as well as lamps that generate light,

00:07:52.242 --> 00:07:55.968
from energy via the panels.

00:07:57.044 --> 00:08:02.266
(Man) Guajira is a forgotten,
abandoned region of the country,

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.197
where public services don't exist,
and there is need for electricity.

00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:11.166
Tell us a little bit about life
in your community without electricity.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.762
(AG) You have to get up very early,

00:08:13.786 --> 00:08:19.905
and at 6 pm, you're already looking
to hang up your hammock.

00:08:21.651 --> 00:08:24.906
That's the Wayuu within the communities.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.956
Your chores end at 6 pm.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.499
But having light within the community,

00:08:33.924 --> 00:08:36.855
inside your ranch,

00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:43.645
you actually have more time
during the night to do your activities.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:49.167
As artisans, knitting your backpacks,
making your hammocks.

00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:53.471
Children who are in school,
can do their homework and study.

00:08:53.495 --> 00:08:55.561
(Man) Charging your cell phone,
for example.

00:08:55.585 --> 00:08:59.809
(AG) Charging your cell phone,
and watching TV on a small television

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.708
because the big one doesn't work.

00:09:05.208 --> 00:09:08.220
(Man) What will change
in your community's way of life?

00:09:08.244 --> 00:09:14.806
(AG) It will teach them
to be more responsible

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:21.076
with the things that energy
will bring to their communities.

00:09:21.713 --> 00:09:23.882
Because they are commitments.

00:09:23.906 --> 00:09:28.412
They will be the ones
to take care of that.

00:09:28.436 --> 00:09:33.490
I will supervise them
and do the maintenance.

00:09:33.514 --> 00:09:36.372
But things will change for them;

00:09:36.396 --> 00:09:43.237
if they have trade,
they will have greater earnings

00:09:44.369 --> 00:09:46.631
and they will live better,

00:09:46.655 --> 00:09:49.795
they will have a life change,

00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:52.951
for the better.

00:09:52.975 --> 00:09:57.292
(Man) When you returned home
after 6 months, how were you welcomed?

00:09:59.996 --> 00:10:01.349
(AG) It was crazy.

00:10:01.373 --> 00:10:02.539
(Laughter)

00:10:02.563 --> 00:10:06.763
They had a big, crazy party for me.

00:10:06.787 --> 00:10:08.448
(Man) And what did they ask you?

00:10:08.472 --> 00:10:11.456
(AG) What did you learn,
What did you bring me?

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.160
(Laughter)

00:10:13.184 --> 00:10:17.947
My friends from Zanzibar,
funny Moana and Zubira --

00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:19.637
I will never forget their names --

00:10:20.969 --> 00:10:27.486
The Nicaraguans were very humble with me,

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.083
they were always around me.

00:10:30.107 --> 00:10:33.762
My teachers were Hindu

00:10:34.822 --> 00:10:39.899
and there was a teacher
who was married to a Hindu

00:10:39.923 --> 00:10:41.949
but she was Muslim,

00:10:41.973 --> 00:10:43.588
she was very dear to me.

00:10:43.612 --> 00:10:46.727
She was always attentive, asking
"What are you doing, Anastasia?

00:10:46.751 --> 00:10:53.563
What do you want? And if I was in pain,
they would come every day to check on me.

00:10:54.483 --> 00:10:58.055
If I was sick, "Pain?"
"No teacher, no pain."

00:10:58.079 --> 00:10:59.918
(Laughing)

00:10:59.942 --> 00:11:05.465
One day she came and said,
but quite happily, "Dollar?"

00:11:05.489 --> 00:11:09.378
I didn't know what a dollar was;
they pronounce it "doller" there

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:15.201
and that day I had knee pain, so I said,
"Teacher, dolor, dolor [pain, pain]."

00:11:15.225 --> 00:11:17.609
"No, no, dollar, dollar."

00:11:17.633 --> 00:11:22.444
They had given us a few dollars
to keep, just in case.

00:11:22.468 --> 00:11:27.376
When I showed her my knee,
she said, "No, no, dollar, dollar."

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.529
And she takes out some cash and shows me.
"Oh, teacher, I don't understand you."

00:11:31.553 --> 00:11:32.866
(Laughter)

00:11:35.923 --> 00:11:37.908
It's very different.

00:11:37.932 --> 00:11:41.382
When we arrived we didn't
understand each another.

00:11:41.406 --> 00:11:44.288
For example, they would use
a broom for sweeping,

00:11:44.312 --> 00:11:47.815
and the person holding the broom
said to me, "Room."

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:53.682
I thought "room" meant "car,"
and the "room" is where you go to sleep.

00:11:53.706 --> 00:11:57.647
"Room, room," he said,
so I responded, "Teacher, no room."

00:11:57.671 --> 00:12:00.947
(Laughter)

00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:03.713
(Applause)

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:09.907
(Man) What lesson do you want
women to share

00:12:09.931 --> 00:12:12.991
with other indigenous and non-indigenous
communities in Columbia?

00:12:13.015 --> 00:12:16.143
What lesson do you want
to tell them about?

00:12:16.167 --> 00:12:19.261
Like, "This is what I learned,
this is what I want to share."

00:12:19.285 --> 00:12:22.565
(Man) To all the indigenous
women of Columbia,

00:12:22.589 --> 00:12:25.881
let's plan out our ideas,

00:12:25.905 --> 00:12:31.152
implement them,
and put them into practice.

00:12:31.176 --> 00:12:35.039
Before, I have never had
the opportunity to go somewhere,

00:12:35.063 --> 00:12:37.738
not even to another county.

00:12:37.762 --> 00:12:43.128
And I still took the risk to go to India
and learn something new.

00:12:43.152 --> 00:12:46.493
I thought, "How will I be able
to learn solar engineering

00:12:46.517 --> 00:12:48.986
if I don't know anything about it?"

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:53.694
I didn't know anything, but I learned.

00:12:53.718 --> 00:12:58.786
Like a child starting to learn the ABC,

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:03.502
By saying it out load,
one, two, three, a thousand times.

00:13:03.526 --> 00:13:07.573
Doing small numbers,
and that's how we learned.

00:13:08.843 --> 00:13:13.822
(Man) The Wayuu are the largest
indigenous people group,

00:13:13.846 --> 00:13:17.363
and the Wayuu language
is something we shouldn't lose.

00:13:17.387 --> 00:13:22.856
I, we, would love for you to give us
some words of encouragement

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.489
inviting us to move forward,

00:13:24.513 --> 00:13:27.124
inviting all these women to start now.

00:13:27.148 --> 00:13:29.649
Please give us a few words
in the Wayuu language

00:13:29.673 --> 00:13:31.855
and explain what it means.

00:13:33.381 --> 00:13:37.928
(AG speaking in Wayuu)

00:13:47.538 --> 00:13:54.188
"Thank you to everyone here
for listening."

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:02.921
Once again, I'd like to say
that we're making our project a reality

00:14:02.945 --> 00:14:06.926
for the benefit of all humanity.

00:14:08.261 --> 00:14:11.340
(Applause)

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.952
