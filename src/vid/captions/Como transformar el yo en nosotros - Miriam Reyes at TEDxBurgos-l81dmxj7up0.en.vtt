00:00:22.317 --> 00:00:27.299
Six years ago, I took a 600 kilometer trip
to meet someone who would change my life.

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:33.480
That person is my cousin José.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.355
And we all fell in love with that smile.

00:00:37.355 --> 00:00:41.360
But when he was two and a half,
something happened.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.968
That smile disappeared.

00:00:43.968 --> 00:00:48.501
He stopped learning new words,
he didn't look you in the eye,

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:52.514
and when you called to him,
he didn't pay attention.

00:00:52.514 --> 00:00:57.909
We went to one doctor, then another,
and the diagnosis was autism.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.797
You have a cousin
whom you love so much,

00:01:02.797 --> 00:01:05.354
and he's diagnosed
with autism: What do you do?

00:01:05.354 --> 00:01:08.411
Well, you do something.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.266
On his third birthday,

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:19.282
I wrote the happy birthday
song in pictograms.

00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:24.019
I arrived at my aunt's house and sang,

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:27.019
(Singing) "José, happy birthday to you,

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:31.072
Happy birthday, happy birthday,
happy birthday to you!"

00:01:31.072 --> 00:01:33.302
What does José do?

00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:36.632
He takes my piece of paper
and goes running to his mother,

00:01:36.632 --> 00:01:39.412
singing her the birthday song.

00:01:39.412 --> 00:01:42.853
And he goes running to his father
and sings him the birthday song.

00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:47.344
And that was his way of showing us
that that's how he learned.

00:01:51.168 --> 00:01:55.279
Time passed, and we wrote
the "José's Underpants" song.

00:01:56.647 --> 00:02:00.060
A story for him about leaving diapers
behind and only using the toilet.

00:02:00.142 --> 00:02:02.075
It worked very well with him.

00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:05.410
And I'd been searching on the Internet
for material to use with him.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.545
I didn't find any,
so I decided to share this.

00:02:09.545 --> 00:02:10.907
I posted it on a blank blog,

00:02:10.907 --> 00:02:14.019
just the story and a sentence
from the pictogram story

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.423
for leaving diapers behind
and only using the toilet.

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:21.090
And then they started to write to me.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.676
Mothers, professionals

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:26.264
from every corner of the globe,
wrote to me to say,

00:02:26.264 --> 00:02:28.584
"Thank you for sharing this material,

00:02:28.584 --> 00:02:30.904
because we're also looking

00:02:30.904 --> 00:02:34.346
for this kind of material
to use with our children."

00:02:35.912 --> 00:02:38.599
Then I began to tell my story.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.701
I went to the neighborhood fruit vendor
and told him what happened

00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:48.221
and told my colleagues
from school, and my friends.

00:02:48.611 --> 00:02:51.420
And then people began to join me.

00:02:51.975 --> 00:02:59.158
And they said, "This dream that you have,

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:02.459
of writing stories
and making them available

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.760
to everyone who needs them,
we're joining it."

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.989
And then came the first illustrator

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.098
who said she would
illustrate the stories,

00:03:10.098 --> 00:03:13.198
and the first companies
that joined, with their professionals.

00:03:13.198 --> 00:03:15.015
And the first anonymous person

00:03:15.015 --> 00:03:17.603
who posted about us
telling our story on their blog.

00:03:17.603 --> 00:03:21.568
And so, little by little,
what was once a dream

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:25.533
transformed into reality.

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:29.498
I had been working
in Switzerland for a year.

00:03:29.498 --> 00:03:32.263
And during that year,
before making the decision

00:03:32.263 --> 00:03:35.105
to tell that story, was a process.

00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:39.137
I had to decide
that I wanted to do this.

00:03:39.137 --> 00:03:41.413
I thought about it and said:

00:03:41.413 --> 00:03:45.189
"There are a lot of families,
a lot of professionals who need this:

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.216
there truly is a social demand for it."

00:03:48.782 --> 00:03:51.967
And sometimes I'd daydream and say,

00:03:51.967 --> 00:03:55.152
"And what if I do create this material,

00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:58.337
and put it in the hands
of everyone who needs it?"

00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:05.835
And one day, shortly before returning
to Spain, I took the first step and said,

00:04:06.618 --> 00:04:11.276
"I'm going to believe in my dreams
and I'm going to do it."

00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:13.649
And I still don't know how,

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:17.094
but I had decided
that I was going to do it.

00:04:17.094 --> 00:04:20.191
As I began to tell my story,
people began to join me

00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:22.888
and the project started to grow.

00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:26.676
In the meantime, I continued
as an architecture student.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.683
And I had to complete
my graduation project.

00:04:31.817 --> 00:04:35.468
So the graduation project
consists, basically,

00:04:35.468 --> 00:04:39.242
of designing a building, performing
the structural and system calculations,

00:04:39.838 --> 00:04:42.698
and taking, on average,
one year to build it.

00:04:45.196 --> 00:04:48.932
It was at that time
that I discovered how exciting

00:04:48.932 --> 00:04:51.878
it was to work on something you liked,

00:04:51.878 --> 00:04:54.615
because for me,
that idea of collaborating,

00:04:54.615 --> 00:04:58.162
albeit just a little,
so that those 67 million

00:04:58.162 --> 00:05:00.599
autistic children around the world

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:03.360
could develop their potential
a little more,

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.673
was something indescribable.

00:05:06.413 --> 00:05:09.862
And I rejected the idea
of spending the next year of my life

00:05:09.862 --> 00:05:12.191
completing a very pretty
graduation project

00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:17.303
that the professors would really like,
but would only serve to gain me a degree.

00:05:18.745 --> 00:05:22.859
So I decided to look for someone
who needed something.

00:05:22.859 --> 00:05:25.869
I started contacting autism organizations.

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:28.879
I started by calling an NGO in India.

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:32.579
All of this under enormous pressure
called parents, and they're telling you,

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:34.583
"Finish your major already!"

00:05:35.443 --> 00:05:39.682
When months had already passed,
and I believed I wouldn't reach my goal,

00:05:39.702 --> 00:05:42.121
I found a pharmaceutical
company in Seville

00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:44.880
that was undertaking an initiative

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.263
to declare African music

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:49.936
an immaterial patrimony of humanity.

00:05:49.936 --> 00:05:52.512
And among other things,
one of the things it was doing

00:05:52.512 --> 00:05:56.078
was the construction
of a traditional music

00:05:56.078 --> 00:05:59.244
and dance hall
in Burkina Faso,in Africa.

00:06:00.008 --> 00:06:02.688
So I spoke with the architect
and that idea seemed

00:06:02.688 --> 00:06:05.138
pretty good to him, using
that entire year of work

00:06:05.138 --> 00:06:07.589
that I had to do anyway;

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:11.500
to learn, complete my degree,
finish my training,

00:06:11.891 --> 00:06:16.384
and that it would have a positive impact
on other people, on others.

00:06:17.764 --> 00:06:19.705
I began designing the project

00:06:20.305 --> 00:06:24.466
and, of course, realized
that I had a lot of questions.

00:06:24.466 --> 00:06:27.734
Because I knew what it was like here,
but what was it like there?

00:06:29.446 --> 00:06:30.418
I didn't know.

00:06:31.622 --> 00:06:34.141
I started researching
their cultures, their customs.

00:06:34.141 --> 00:06:36.580
And I was designing it, but I said,

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.180
"This is what I think they need,
not necessarily what they need."

00:06:41.382 --> 00:06:43.065
So I went there.

00:06:47.085 --> 00:06:50.620
I got together with them,
sat down at a table

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.155
with the king's musician,
the Minister of Culture,

00:06:54.155 --> 00:06:57.690
the local association
undertaking the project.

00:07:00.548 --> 00:07:04.630
I began listening to them,
because that's cooperation, right?

00:07:04.634 --> 00:07:08.222
I learn from you, you learn from me,
and we do something together.

00:07:09.798 --> 00:07:13.882
Then, I returned to Spain,
with a lot of answers.

00:07:13.882 --> 00:07:17.663
I designed the project: it was going
to be a project with three rooms,

00:07:17.663 --> 00:07:20.674
a central plaza, and we'd do it
with local materials.

00:07:20.674 --> 00:07:22.998
We were going to take
the same land from the site

00:07:22.998 --> 00:07:25.322
to make some pressed bricks,

00:07:25.322 --> 00:07:27.647
with which we would be
constructing the building.

00:07:29.765 --> 00:07:31.949
We were going to construct it differently.

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:36.483
I had been taught that you call
a builder and he builds it.

00:07:36.577 --> 00:07:39.803
But there, we did it
with a technical school,

00:07:39.803 --> 00:07:43.198
where 20 young people, boys and girls,
at risk of social exclusion,

00:07:43.198 --> 00:07:46.453
were learning a trade
while we constructed the building.

00:07:47.731 --> 00:07:51.628
It also had to give true
economic sustainability to the project,

00:07:51.628 --> 00:07:54.081
because when I had been there,

00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:56.947
I saw there were many
cooperative projects,

00:07:56.947 --> 00:08:00.695
that came, did something, but afterwards,
they didn't think about continuity.

00:08:00.703 --> 00:08:02.751
So abandoned projects remained.

00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:07.278
Each building was designed
for it to function.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:10.955
Inside, it would generate activity
that created employment.

00:08:10.955 --> 00:08:15.823
That would give economic sustainability
to its own local community.

00:08:17.016 --> 00:08:22.310
And then, you realize you're not only
designing a building.

00:08:23.306 --> 00:08:27.183
You're learning a whole lot more
than what you initially went to learn.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.848
I won a scholarship.

00:08:31.994 --> 00:08:36.229
And I went, after earning my degree,
to construct this building.

00:08:38.166 --> 00:08:43.665
And there I was, fighting in half-French
with the construction workers.

00:08:44.144 --> 00:08:47.134
I've never learned more in my entire life.

00:08:48.412 --> 00:08:51.465
Moreover, you realize
that what you're doing

00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:57.338
has a very positive impact on others,
but that it comes back around.

00:08:59.844 --> 00:09:04.967
You realize that by giving, you receive.

00:09:06.147 --> 00:09:08.708
And you receive much more
than what you've given.

00:09:11.763 --> 00:09:15.955
You get there and it's the workshop,

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:20.367
the first to train boys and girls
that are learning how to dance,

00:09:20.367 --> 00:09:24.720
and see their faces able to tell you
what they have learned.

00:09:26.661 --> 00:09:29.265
And you arrive here and go
to José's birthday party,

00:09:29.265 --> 00:09:31.869
who is now six years old

00:09:31.869 --> 00:09:34.475
and is smiling and happy again.

00:09:36.312 --> 00:09:40.642
And you say, "What is distance?

00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:45.986
What is the true distance
between what I have to do,

00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:48.401
because it's my profession,

00:09:48.401 --> 00:09:51.877
I have to educate myself,
or it's useful for my personal

00:09:51.877 --> 00:09:54.503
or professional development,

00:09:54.503 --> 00:09:59.108
and for that to have
a positive impact on us?

00:09:59.108 --> 00:10:01.723
On others, in society?"

00:10:01.723 --> 00:10:08.318
I think that you only have to take
the first step, to say I'm going to do it,

00:10:09.097 --> 00:10:11.633
and then, then we'll think about how.

00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:13.597
Thank you very much.

00:10:13.597 --> 00:10:16.887
(Applause)
